# High-Availability vs Fault-Tolerance vs Disaster Recovery

|#|HA|FT|DR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|HA is simply means, maximizing system's online time|FT is simply the ability to keep operating properly even through the failures & while they are being fixed|DR is simply, what to plan for and do when a system gets knocked out when a disaster get occured (When HA & FT fails, what then?)|
|2|Aims to ensure an agreed level of operational preformance, usually uptime, for a higher than the normal period |FT is the property that enables the system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some (one or more within) of its' components|A set of policies, tools & procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure & systems, following a natural or human-induced disaster|
|3|In HA, when there's a downtime, user distruption is OK.|HA is being addressed within FT & FT cost more time & money compared to HA|DR is about, what happen before (pre-planning) & what happen after the disaster|
