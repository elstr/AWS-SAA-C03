# Cloud Computing Introduction

### 5 Characteristics of the Cloud

1. **On-Demand Self Service:**
    - Ability to provision capabilities (storage, database, network, computing, security, etc.) for your product/service by user self as needed, "without requiring humen interation".
    - No need to visit vendor.
    - No need to contact support and get your requirement get done.
2. **Broad Network Access:**
    - Ability to use & manage capablities (storage, database, network, computing, security, etc.) over the "network" using "standard machanisams" like http, https, ssh, ftp, vpn, etc.
    - No need of a private link to access your resources.
    - No need to visit your vendor to access your resources.
3. **Resource Pooling:**
    - Resources/capabilities (database, storage, network bandwith) are pooled in large scale.
    - Serve multiple consumers in a multi tenant way, while allocating & disallocating resources according to their demand.
    - Eliminates the sense of actual location of physical hardware so that consumers don't have a control or knowladge on them.
    - Harware & their locations becomes virtual things to consumers.
    - Consumers won't be setting up hardware & maintaining them.
    - For consumers, capacity of the capabilities are limitless.
 4. **Rapid Elasticity:**
     - Provisioning of capabilities (database, storage, computing, networking) should get increased & decreased rapidly (elastically) based on the realtime demand of the resources.
     - To consumer ability to provision the capabilities should appear as unlimited.
4. **Measured Service:** Usage of the consumers' resources should be able to monitred, controlled, reported & billed. (Pay for what you consume)

### Types of Clouds
- Public Cloud: Should satisfy the 5 characteristics of the Cloud & available to general public (Ex: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- Private Cloud: Should satisfy the 5 characteristics of the Cloud but only dedicated to consumer's business and runs "on premises"
- Multi Cloud: Cloud solution that utilizes multiple public clouds of different cloud vendors in one solution. (Ex: AWS + Azure)
- Hybrid Cloud: Cloud solution that utilize public cloud and private cloud togather. (Not public cloud + on premises resources)
