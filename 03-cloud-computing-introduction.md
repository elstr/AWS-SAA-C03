# Cloud Computing Introduction

1. **On-Demand Self Service:** Ability to provision capabilities (storage, database, network, computing, security, etc.) for your product/service by user self as needed, "without requiring humen interation".
    - No need to visit vendor
    - No need to contact support and get your requirement get done
2. **Broad Network Access:** Ability to use & manage capablities (storage, database, network, computing, security, etc.) over the "network" using "standard machanisams" like http, https, ssh, ftp, vpn, etc.
    - No need of a private link to access your resources
    - No need to visit your vendor to access your resources
3. **Resource Pooling:**
    - Resources/capabilities (database, storage, network bandwith) are pooled in large scale.
    - Serve multiple consumers in a multi tenant way, while allocating & disallocating resources according to their demand.
    - Eliminates the sense of actual location of physical hardware so that consumers don't have a control or knowladge on them.
    - Harware & their locations becomes virtual things to consumers
    - Consumers won't be setting up hardware & maintaining them
    - For consumers, capacity of the capabilities are limitless.
 4. **Rapid Elasticity:** Provisioning of capabilities (database, storage, computing, networking) should get increased & decreased rapidly (elastically) based on the realtime demand of the resources.
     - To consumer ability to provision the capabilities should appear as unlimited.
