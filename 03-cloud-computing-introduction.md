# Cloud Computing Introduction

1. **On-Demand Self Service:** Ability to provision capabilities (storage, database, network, computing, security, etc.) for your product/service by user self as needed, "without requiring humen interation".
    - No need to visit vendor
    - No need to contact support and get your requirement get done
2. **Broad Network Access:** Ability to use & manage capablities (storage, database, network, computing, security, etc.) over the "network" using "standard machanisams" like http, https, ssh, ftp, vpn, etc.
    - No need private link for your resources
    - No need to visit your vendor to access your resources
3. **Resource Pooling:** Resources/capabilities (database, storage, network bandwith) are pooled to serve multiple consumers in a multi tenant way, while allocating & disallocating resources according to the behaviour of the demand. This eliminates the sense of actual location of physical hardwares so that consumers don't have a control or knowladge on them.
